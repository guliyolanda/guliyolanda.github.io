        <h3>Modeling in Membrane Process</h3>
	<ul>
		The performance of a membrane module is determined by the complex flow inside the membrane flow channels and the mass transfers across the membranes. The coupled effects build the difficulty to either predict the performance or optimize the desalination system. What my research focus on include both system-level optimization and the detailed flow dynamics and mass transfer inside the module.
	</ul>
	<h4>1. Membrane module/stack model</h4>
	<center>
	<img src='images/ro_module_copy.png'>
	</center>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
	       Membrane module/stack models are powerful tools to optimize the mechanical design of the module/stack and the system.
	       </li>
		<li>
	            The coupled effects between the nonlinear feed flow and the mass transfer of both water and salts across the membrane are considered in a coupled CFD-based modeling. These models that are validated with experimental data.
		</li>
		<li>
		    Concentration polarisation (CP) effects negatively the mass transport cross the membrane, which can be diminished by reducing the thinkness of boundary layer.
            	</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>2. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of spacer-promoted channel flow</h4>
	<ul>
	 I developed a CFD spacer-promoted flow model in OpenFOAM and in-house code GPDE, and verified the codes with experimental data. The developed CFD model will precisely simulate the complex flow and mass transfer coupling to improve the scaled-up system model and the understanding of the scaled-down micro-channel flow dynamics.
	</ul>
	 <center>
	<img src='images/mem_proc_channel.png'>
	</center>
	<p></p>
        <ul>
	    <li>
	       Spacers/filaments improve the permeation by interrupting the boundary layer and enhancing the flow mixing, but also result in additional pressure loss.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Solute consentration (passive scalar in the flow field) is balanced by its convection, diffusion and source. 
	    </li>
            </ul>

	    <h4>3. Gradient-based optimization of spacer shape</h4>
	<ul>
Current optimisation methods are mainly based on try-and-error. I developed a new framework of gradient-based shape optimization of spacer design loop via using discrete adjoint approach. 
	</ul>
	<center>
	<img src='images/sensitivities.png'>
	</center>
	<ul>
	       <li>
	     The trade-off between pressure loss and water permeation (indicated in the sensitivity distribution) increase challenges of the spacer design in membrane channels. 
             </li>
	      <li>
         	  The discrete adjoint method (for sensitivity computation) will significantly reduce the convergence iteration time for guarantee an optimal design.

	     <li>
		 Compared to the standard zigzag spacer design, the optimal spacer reduces pressure loss by 24% with a permeation drop in the flow channel of only 0.43%.
	     </li>
	      <li>
                 Gradient-based optimisation using discrete adjoint approach allows spacer shape design with more complex geometries.
